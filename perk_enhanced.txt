                        Fullscreen Statusbar Mod

Description : If you know the mod by Per Kristian for the Doom weapons to
              improve their animations, then you can imagine what this is 
              about: It's almost the same, but the Doomguy's gloves can also
              be black if you want (to match the Doom box cover art).
 
              Additionally, the following improvements have been implemented
              compared to the original PerK mod:
                - Fists: now also with gloves (optional)
                - Pistol: light from the left (like original), visible arm
                  Note: Fist and pistol handedness can be toggled in the menu
                - Chainsaw: has more idle frames
                - Shotgun: improved muzzleflash, reload frames optimized
                - Super Shotgun: missing hand for one frame added,
                  minor tweaks for two frames
                - Chaingun: rotation/firing behavior fixed
                - Plasmagun: two additional frames while firing
                - BFG 9000: now also has smooth animations
                - Smooth sprites for the rocket explosion, plasma and BFG shots
